## Description
The Seam Exception Handling module creates a simple, yet robust base for other modules and users to
create a custom and complete exception handling process. Exception handling is done using CDI events,
keeping exception handling noninvasive and also helping the program or module to stay minimally coupled
to the exception handling framework.
