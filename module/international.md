## Description
Internationalization and localization are very important for those of us who develop applications for non-English speakers, 
but is unfortunately poorly supported in various places in Java. It certainly isn't seamless to configure.

Seam aims to provide a unified approach to configuring your application for the right locale, propagating the locale to all 
aspects of the application.
